# Emergency Service App
An Android App that reaches out to emergency services through Safe Trek's REST API and shares the alarm to Facebook. The app connects to a user's profile and creates a Facebook Post when the user sends an alarm.

The user can customize his Facebook message if desired as well as can enable/disable whether he wants to share his location.
